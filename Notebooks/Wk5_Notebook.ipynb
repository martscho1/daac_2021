    "In accounting research and practice, textual data - which may originate from different sources - is increasingly being quantitatively analyzed. A quantitative analysis of such data requires that the (unstructured) data first needs to be transformed into numerical measures representing variables of interest (structured data). Different kinds of quantitative analysis of textual data - such as measuring document sentiment (tone), text complexity (readability) and textual similarity - can next be used to study a variety of accounting topics. The Python ecosystem, both Python itself and specialized libraries such as NLTK, offers many great functionalities to conduct a quantitative analysis of textual data. In this notebook, I will provide an introduction to some specific textual analysis methods and techniques commonly used in accounting research."

    "The text data preprocessing process is an important part of a typical text analytics project. Much of the methods that are used in this process have their roots in natural language processing. Text preprocessing takes an input of raw text and returns cleansed tokens. Tokens are single words or groups of words that are tallied by their frequency and serve as the features of the analysis. The preprocessing process consists of a number of steps in which the text data are standardized by removing unnecessary information from the original text. Anandarajan et al. (2019) provide the following figure to describe the text data preprocessing process (note that below I discuss the different steps in a slightly different order):\n",

    "The tasks in the different preprocessing steps can typically be solved in different ways. In this notebook, I don't show all possibilities, but instead I will show the solutions that I personally prefer the most. Also, I will show solutions for both the situation in which a single text (i.e., string) needs to be preprocessed, as well as the situation in which text data (i.e., strings) that is included in a column of a DataFrame needs to be preprocessed."

    "An important preprocessing task is making sure that all characters share the same type of case (i.e., either all upper- or lowercase), where researchers mostly choose to make them all lowercase. When preprocessing a single string, you can use the `lower()` (string) method for this purpose. When preprocessing strings that are included in a column of a DataFrame, you can either use the `lower()` (string) method (preceded by `str.`) for this purpose, or apply (by using the `apply()` method) a `lambda` function that uses the `join()`, `split()` and `lower()` (string) methods (see below)."

When preprocessing a single string, you can then call this function to remove the punctuation and special characters from the text.

    "Another important preprocessing task is removing the stopwords from the text. Stopwords are very common words that carry no meaning or less meaning compared to other keywords. If you remove the commonly used words, you can focus on the important keywords. It is important to emphasize that: (a) no universal list of stopwords exists since what is considered uninformative depends on the context of the application, and (b) we do not always remove the stopwords. The different natural language processing libraries each contain a stopwords list, and also many variations of these lists exist and are used in practice. For example, Tim Loughran and Bill McDonald have developed several stopword lists (see https://sraf.nd.edu/textual-analysis/resources/). For most cases, they recommend using their \"generic\" list, which is based on the stopword list used by the NLTK library. Their other lists are context specific and not necessarily exhaustive. When preprocessing a single string, you can use list comprehension in combination with the `join()` and `split()` (string) methods and the `not` and `in` keywords for this purpose. When preprocessing strings that are included in a column of a DataFrame, you can apply (by using the `apply()` method) a `lambda` function that uses the `join()` and `split()` (string) methods and the `not` and `in` keywords (see below). (It is important to note that when analyzing real-world text data, it may first be necessary to adjust an existing stopword list by either adding words to the list or removing words from the list.

    "Another important preprocessing task, which is not always but may be done, is to perform either stemming or lemmatization on the documents. Stemming and lemmatization involve breaking words down to their root word. As explained by Arandarajan et al. (2019, p. 54), \"Stemming involves the removal of a word’s suffix to reduce the size of the vocabulary. Lemmatization is similar to stemming, except it incorporates information about the term’s part of speech. Both methods combine words that contain the same root into a single token to reduce the number of unique tokens within the analysis set.\" In this notebook, I will only show how to do stemming, as this seems to be more often used in accounting research than lemmatization. The different natural language processing libraries offer special methods for this task (e.g., the `PorterStemmer()` method that is available when using the NLTK library), which can both be used for this purpose when preprocessing a single string and when preprocessing strings that are included in a column of a DataFrame. When preprocessing a single string, you then also need to use list comprehension. When preprocessing strings that are included in a column of a DataFrame, you can apply (by using the `apply()` method) a `lambda` function that uses list comprehension and the `join()` (string) method and a special stemming method for this purpose (see below)."

    "Overall, there are two ways to identify meaningful information content in the form of sentiment (tone) from text documents (Anand et al., 2020, *FTA*): (1) using machine learning and (2) using pre-determined dictionaries of word classifications. With the first approach, an algorithm first looks for differentiating patterns in previously labeled textual data, and then it applies learned patterns to label the remaining unlabeled data. With the second approach, textual analysis relies on an input dictionary (provided by the researcher), where each textual document is represented by its relative frequencies of words from the input dictionary. In this notebook, I will focus on the second approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many different dictionaries available for sentiment (tone) analysis, not only general purpose dictionaries, but also dictionaries that have especially been developed for the business domain. For example, Tim Loughran and Bill McDonald have developed a number of dictionaries (wordlists) that are widely used in accounting and finance research (see https://sraf.nd.edu/textual-analysis/resources/). And depending on your research question, you can always construct your own dictionary. Before performing a large scale word count based on a specific dictionary, it is important to understand the structure of the input dictionary. That is, it is typically necessary to first perform a preprocessing process (such as the one described above, although there can also be additional issues that preferably are taken care of, such as negations) before being able to do the actual sentiment (tone) analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to be aware that these kinds of analyses, similar to many other kinds of textual analyses, rely on the critical assumption of independence of words. In this context, this implies that the order, and thus direct context, of a word (as part of a document) is unimportant. Approaches where word sequence is ignored are typically labeled as ‘bag-of-words’ approaches. With such approaches, each piece of text is represented as a vector of words and their counts. Anand et al. (2020, *FTA*, p. 295-296) provide the following example to make this clear:  \n",
    "\n",
    "\"For example, phrases “cash flows from operations” and “cash flows from investing” can be represented as vectors u and v, respectively, as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "| | Cash | Flows | From | Investing | Operations |\n",
    "| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n",
    "| u | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "| v | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, vector u = (1, 1, 1, 0, 1) is defined on a feature space of all words present in the two phrases above, and includes 1 for each word occurrence in phrase “cash flows from operations”, and 0 for each word absence. If the word “cash” appeared two times in that phrase (e.g., “cash flows from cash operations”), vector u would include 2 for “cash” word component: u = (2, 1, 1, 0, 1). Vector v represents word counts for “cash flows from investing” and is defined in a similar manner. Note that the order of words, their part of speech, sentence structure, and other linguistic information is not recorded in bag-of-words vectors.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Another important issue to be aware of is that in these kinds of analyses sentiment (tone) can be measured in different ways, such as:\n",
    "- Proportion of words, which is equal to the total number of times that the words from the wordlist occur in the text normalized by (i.e., divided by) the total number of words in the text.\n",
    "- Unique counts of words, which is equal to the number of words from the wordlist that occur at least once in the text normalized by (i.e., divided by) the number of words in the wordlist.\n",

      "Non-GAAP Measures Unless otherwise indicated, our non-GAAP measures discussed in this MD&A are related to our continuing operations and not our discontinued operations. Our non-GAAP measures include: earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT)-adjusted, presented net of noncontrolling interests; earnings before income taxes (EBT)-adjusted for our GM Financial segment; earnings per share (EPS)-diluted-adjusted; effective tax rate-adjusted (ETR-adjusted); return on invested capital-adjusted (ROIC-adjusted) and adjusted automotive free cash flow. Our calculation of these non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential differences between companies in the method of calculation. As a result, the use of these non-GAAP measures has limitations and should not be considered superior to, in isolation from, or as a substitute for, related U.S. GAAP measures.\n",
      "These non-GAAP measures allow management and investors to view operating trends, perform analytical comparisons and benchmark performance between periods and among geographic regions to understand operating performance without regard to items we do not consider a component of our core operating performance. Furthermore, these non-GAAP measures allow investors the opportunity to measure and monitor our performance against our externally communicated targets and evaluate the investment decisions being made by management to improve ROIC-adjusted. Management uses these measures in its financial, investment and operational decision-making processes, for internal reporting and as part of its forecasting and budgeting processes. Further, our Board of Directors uses certain of these and other measures as key metrics to determine management performance under our performance-based compensation plans. For these reasons we believe these non-GAAP measures are useful for our investors.\n",
      "EBIT-adjusted EBIT-adjusted is presented net of noncontrolling interests and is used by management and can be used by investors to review our consolidated operating results because it excludes automotive interest income, automotive interest expense and income taxes as well as certain additional adjustments that are not considered part of our core operations. Examples of adjustments to EBIT include but are not limited to impairment charges on long-lived assets and other exit costs resulting from strategic shifts in our operations or discrete market and business conditions; costs arising from the ignition switch recall and related legal matters; and certain currency devaluations associated with hyperinflationary economies. For EBIT-adjusted and our other non-GAAP measures, once we have made an adjustment in the current period for an item, we will also adjust the related non-GAAP measure in any future periods in which there is an impact from the item. Our corresponding measure for our GM Financial segment is EBT-adjusted.\n",
      "EPS-diluted-adjusted EPS-diluted-adjusted is used by management and can be used by investors to review our consolidated diluted EPS results on a consistent basis. EPS-diluted-adjusted is calculated as net income attributable to common stockholders-diluted less income (loss) from discontinued operations on an after-tax basis, adjustments noted above for EBIT-adjusted and certain income tax adjustments divided by weighted-average common shares outstanding-diluted. Examples of income tax adjustments include the establishment or reversal of significant deferred tax asset valuation allowances.\n",
      "ETR-adjusted ETR-adjusted is used by management and can be used by investors to review the consolidated effective tax rate for our core operations on a consistent basis. ETR-adjusted is calculated as Income tax expense less the income tax related to the adjustments noted above for EBIT-adjusted and the income tax adjustments noted above for EPS-diluted-adjusted divided by Income before income taxes less adjustments. When we provide an expected adjusted effective tax rate, we do not provide an expected effective tax rate because the U.S. GAAP measure may include significant adjustments that are difficult to predict.\n",

We define ROIC-adjusted as EBIT-adjusted for the trailing four quarters divided by ROIC-adjusted average net assets, which is considered to be the average equity balances adjusted for average automotive debt and interest liabilities, exclusive of finance leases; average automotive net pension and other postretirement benefits (OPEB) liabilities; and average automotive net income tax assets during the same period. Adjustments to the average equity balances exclude assets and liabilities classified as either assets held for sale or liabilities held for sale.\n",
      "Adjusted automotive free cash flow Adjusted automotive free cash flow is used by management and can be used by investors to review the liquidity of our automotive operations and to measure and monitor our performance against our capital allocation program and evaluate our automotive liquidity against the substantial cash requirements of our automotive operations. We measure adjusted automotive free cash flow as automotive operating cash flow from continuing operations less capital expenditures adjusted for management actions. Management actions can include voluntary events such as discretionary contributions to employee benefit plans or nonrecurring specific events such as a closure of a facility that are considered special for EBIT-adjusted purposes.

Our plan includes several major initiatives that we anticipate will redefine the future of personal mobility and advance our vision of zero crashes, zero emissions, zero congestion while also strengthening the core of our business: earning customers for life by delivering winning vehicles, leading the industry in quality and safety and improving the customer ownership experience; leading in technology and innovation, including electrification, autonomous vehicles and data connectivity; growing our brands; making tough, strategic decisions about the markets and products in which we will invest and compete; building profitable adjacent businesses; and targeting 10% core margins on an EBIT-adjusted basis.\n",
      "Our collective bargaining agreement with the UAW, which was ratified in November 2015, expired on September 14, 2019. The UAW went on strike on September 16, 2019, causing subsequent stoppages to most vehicle production and parts distribution across our North America facilities. On October 25, 2019, the UAW ratified a new collectively bargained labor agreement (Labor Agreement). The Labor Agreement, which has a term of four years, covers the wages, hours, benefits and other terms and conditions of employment for our UAW-represented employees. The key terms and provisions of the Labor Agreement are:\n",
      "• Lump sum ratification bonus payments to eligible employees of $11,000 and eligible temporary employees of $4,500 in November 2019 totaling $0.5 billion;\n",
      "• Lump sum payments, equivalent to 4% of qualified earnings, to eligible employees in November 2019 and October 2021, totaling approximately $0.2 billion;\n",
      "• Lump sum payments of $1,000 to be made annually to eligible employees in June 2020 through June 2023, totaling approximately $0.2 billion;\n",
      "• Gross wage increases of 3% in 2020 and 2022 for eligible employees, totaling approximately $0.4 billion during the four-year agreement;\n",
      "• Detroit Hamtramck Assembly facility will remain open and receive a new product allocation. Lordstown Assembly, Baltimore Transmission and Warren Transmission facilities will close;\n",
      "• Cash severance incentive programs to qualified employees based on employee interest, eligibility and management approval; and\n",
      "• Additional manufacturing investments of approximately $7.7 billion to create or retain more than 9,000 UAW jobs during the period of the Labor Agreement. \n",
      "Lump sum payments are amortized over the term of the Labor Agreement. Restructuring charges for cash severance incentive programs were recorded in the three months ended December 31, 2019 upon receipt of both employee acceptance and management approval. We expect to offset the Labor Agreement's economics with productivity over the four-year contract period.\n",
      "We estimate that the lost vehicle production volumes and parts sales due to the UAW strike had an unfavorable impact of approximately $3.6 billion on our GMNA EBIT-adjusted in the year ended December 31, 2019. In addition, we estimate an unfavorable pre-tax impact to Net cash provided by operating activities in our consolidated statement of cash flows of approximately $5.4 billion in the year ended December 31, 2019.\n",
      "For the year ending December 31, 2020 we expect EPS-diluted and EPS-diluted-adjusted of between $5.75 and $6.25. We do not consider the potential future impact of adjustments on our expected financial results.\n",
      "We face continuing market, operating and regulatory challenges in a number of countries across the globe due to, among other factors, weak economic conditions, competitive pressures, our product portfolio offerings, heightened emissions standards, labor disruptions, foreign exchange volatility, rising material prices, evolving trade policy and political uncertainty. As a result of these conditions, we continue to strategically assess our performance and ability to achieve acceptable returns on our invested capital, as well as our cost structure in order to maintain a low breakeven point. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors for a discussion on these challenges.\n",
      "In November 2018, we announced plans to accelerate steps to improve our overall business performance, including the reorganization of global product development staffs, the realignment of manufacturing capacity in response to market-related volume declines in passenger cars and a reduction of our salaried workforce. We expect these transformation activities to drive between $5.5 billion and $6.0 billion of annual cash savings by the end of 2020, consisting of $4.0 billion to $4.5 billion in cost savings resulting from reductions primarily in Automotive and other cost of sales in our consolidated financial statements, with the remainder in reduced capital expenditures. We have achieved $3.3 billion in cost savings since inception through staffing, manufacturing and product initiatives. We are on track to reduce capital expenditures from approximately $8.5 billion to approximately $7.0 billion and expect to meet our revised cost savings target by the end of 2020. As we continue to assess our performance and the needs of our evolving business, additional restructuring and rationalization actions could be required. These additional actions could give rise to future asset impairments or other charges, which may have a material impact on our results of operations. We have recorded charges of $1.8 billion in 2019 and $3.1 billion cumulatively related to our 2018 transformation plans, which were complete at December 31, 2019. These charges are primarily considered special for EBIT-adjusted, EPS diluted-adjusted and adjusted automotive free cash flow purposes.\n",

Buick, Chevrolet, Baojun and Wuling sales were softer amid a continued weak automotive industry since the second half of 2018. Additionally, Baojun and Wuling sales were impacted by unfavorable market shifts in vehicle segments. Our Automotive China JVs generated equity income of $1.1 billion in the year ended December 31, 2019. In 2020 we expect to see continued weakness in the industry with a continuation of pricing pressures, a more challenging regulatory environment related to emissions, fuel consumption and new energy vehicles, and continued weakness in the Chinese Yuan against the U.S. Dollar, which will continue to put pressure on our operations in China. We will continue to build upon our strong brands, network, and partnerships in China as well as continue to drive improvements in vehicle mix and cost.\n",
      "Outside of China, industry sales were 25.8 million units in the year ended December 31, 2019, representing a decrease of 3.5% compared to the corresponding period in 2018, primarily due to decreased sales in India and Argentina.

GM Financial's leasing program is exposed to residual values, which are heavily dependent on used vehicle prices. Used vehicle prices decreased 3% in 2019 compared to 2018. We expect a decrease of 3% to 4% in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to the elevated supply of used vehicles in the industry.

Volume measures the impact of changes in wholesale vehicle volumes driven by industry volume, market share and changes in dealer stock levels. Mix measures the impact of changes to the regional portfolio due to product, model, trim, country and option penetration in current year wholesale vehicle volumes. Price measures the impact of changes related to Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price and various sales allowances. Cost primarily includes: (1) material and freight; (2) manufacturing, engineering, advertising, administrative and selling and warranty expense; and (3) non-vehicle related activity. Other primarily includes foreign exchange and non-vehicle related automotive revenues as well as equity income or loss from our nonconsolidated affiliates. Refer to the regional sections of this MD&A for additional information.\n",
      "The most significant element of our Automotive and other cost of sales is material cost, which makes up approximately two-thirds of the total amount. The remaining portion includes labor costs, depreciation and amortization, engineering, freight and product warranty and recall campaigns.\n",
      "Factors that most significantly influence a region's profitability are industry volume, market share, and the relative mix of vehicles (trucks, crossovers, cars) sold. Variable profit is a key indicator of product profitability. Variable profit is defined as revenue less material cost, freight, the variable component of manufacturing expense and warranty and recall-related costs. Vehicles with higher selling prices generally have higher variable profit. Refer to the regional sections of this MD&A for additional information on volume and mix.\n",
      "In the year ended December 31, 2019, favorable Cost was primarily due to: (1) decreased engineering, manufacturing and other costs of $1.5 billion, primarily related to cost savings associated with transformation activities; (2) a benefit of $1.4 billion related to the retrospective recoveries of indirect taxes in Brazil; (3) charges of $1.1 billion primarily in employee separation charges and asset impairments in Korea in 2018; and (4) favorable material performance of $0.8 billion related to carryover vehicles; partially offset by (5) increased material cost of $1.2 billion related to vehicles launched within the last twelve months incorporating significant exterior and/or interior changes (Majors); (6) increase in large campaigns and other warranty-related costs of $1.0 billion; (7) increased raw material and freight costs related to carryover vehicles of $0.5 billion; and (8) a net increase in charges of $0.4 billion primarily in accelerated depreciation and supplier-related charges resulting from transformation activities. In the year ended December 31, 2019 favorable Other was due to the foreign currency effect resulting from the weakening of the Brazilian Real, Korean Won, Argentine Peso and other currencies against the U.S. Dollar.\n",
      "In the year ended December 31, 2019, Automotive and other selling, general and administrative expense decreased primarily due to charges of $0.4 billion for ignition switch related legal matters in 2018 and decreased other costs of $0.5 billion primarily related to cost savings associated with transformation activities.\n",

      "Automotive Financing – GM Financial Liquidity GM Financial's primary sources of cash are finance charge income, leasing income and proceeds from the sale of terminated leased vehicles, net distributions from credit facilities, securitizations, secured and unsecured borrowings and collections and recoveries on finance receivables. GM Financial's primary uses of cash are purchases of retail finance receivables and leased vehicles, the funding of commercial finance receivables, repayment of secured and unsecured debt, funding credit enhancement requirements in connection with securitizations and secured credit facilities, interest costs, and operating expenses. In 2018 GM Financial issued $0.5 billion of Fixed-to-Floating Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series B, $0.01 par value, with a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share. The following table summarizes GM Financial's available liquidity (dollars in billions):\n",
      "In the year ended December 31, 2019, available liquidity decreased primarily due to a decrease in cash and cash equivalents and increased credit facility utilization, resulting from a decrease in issuances of securitizations and unsecured debt. At December 31, 2019, available liquidity was in line with our liquidity targets.\n",
      "GM Financial has access to $16.5 billion of our revolving credit facilities with exclusive access to the 364-day, $2.0 billion facility. Refer to the Automotive Liquidity section of this MD&A for additional details. We have a support agreement with GM Financial which, among other things, establishes commitments of funding from us to GM Financial. This agreement also provides that we will continue to own all of GM Financial’s outstanding voting shares so long as any unsecured debt securities remain outstanding at GM Financial. In addition we are required to use our commercially reasonable efforts to ensure GM Financial remains a subsidiary borrower under our corporate revolving credit facilities.\n",
      "Credit Facilities In the normal course of business, in addition to using its available cash, GM Financial utilizes borrowings under its credit facilities, which may be secured or unsecured, and GM Financial repays these borrowings as appropriate under its cash management strategy. At December 31, 2019 secured, committed unsecured and uncommitted unsecured credit facilities totaled $26.7 billion, $0.4 billion and $1.8 billion with advances outstanding of $6.2 billion, an insignificant amount and $1.8 billion.\n",
      "In the year ended December 31, 2019, Net cash provided by operating activities increased primarily due to a decrease in net collateral posted for derivative positions of $0.8 billion as a result of favorable changes in interest rates on GM Financial’s collateralized derivative portfolio.\n",
      "In the year ended December 31, 2019, Net cash used in investing activities decreased primarily due to: (1) increased collections and recoveries on finance receivables of $6.2 billion; (2) decreased purchases of finance receivables of $3.6 billion; (3) increased proceeds from the termination of leased vehicles of $2.4 billion; and (4) decreased purchases of leased vehicles of $0.3 billion.\n",
      "In the year ended December 31, 2019, Net cash used in financing activities increased primarily due to an increase in debt repayments of $9.2 billion, a decrease in borrowings of $4.8 billion and a decrease in proceeds from issuance of preferred stock of $0.5 billion.\n",
      "Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not currently utilize off-balance sheet securitization arrangements. All trade or finance receivables and related obligations subject to securitization programs are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2019 and 2018.\n",
      "Contractual Obligations and Other Long-Term Liabilities We have minimum commitments under contractual obligations, including purchase obligations. A purchase obligation is defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding on us and that specifies all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased or fixed minimum price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction. Based on these definitions, the following table includes only those contracts that include fixed or minimum obligations. The majority of our purchases are not included in the table as they are made under purchase orders that are requirements-based and accordingly do not specify minimum quantities. The following table summarizes aggregated information about our outstanding contractual obligations and other long-term liabilities at December 31, 2019:\n",
      "The table above does not reflect product warranty and related liabilities, certified pre-owned, extended warranty and free maintenance of $8.6 billion and unrecognized tax benefits of $0.8 billion due to the uncertainty regarding the future cash outflows potentially associated with these amounts. In addition, future cash outflows related to transformation activities announced in November 2018 are not included in the table above. Refer to Note 18 of our consolidated financial statements for additional information.\n",
      "Critical Accounting Estimates The consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which requires the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses in the periods presented. We believe the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and the resulting balances are reasonable; however, due to the inherent uncertainties in developing estimates, actual results could differ from the original estimates, requiring adjustments to these balances in future periods. Refer to Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for our significant accounting policies related to our critical accounting estimates.\n",
      "Product Warranty and Recall Campaigns The estimates related to product warranties are established using historical information on the nature, frequency and average cost of claims of each vehicle line or each model year of the vehicle line and assumptions about future activity and events. When little or no claims experience exists for a model year or a vehicle line, the estimate is based on comparable models.\n",
      "We accrue the costs related to product warranty at the time of vehicle sale and we accrue the estimated cost of recall campaigns when they are probable and estimable, which is generally at the time of sale.\n",
      "The estimates related to recall campaigns accrued at the time of vehicle sale are established by applying a paid loss approach that considers the number of historical recall campaigns and the estimated cost for each recall campaign. These estimates consider the nature, frequency and magnitude of historical recall campaigns, and use key assumptions including the number of historical periods and the weighting of historical data in the reserve studies. Costs associated with recall campaigns not accrued at the time of vehicle sale are estimated based on the estimated cost of repairs and the estimated vehicles to be repaired. Depending on part availability and time to complete repairs we may, from time to time, offer courtesy transportation at no cost to our customers. These estimates are re-evaluated on an ongoing basis and based on the best available information. Revisions are made when necessary based on changes in these factors.\n",
      "The estimated amount accrued for recall campaigns at the time of vehicle sale is most sensitive to the estimated number of recall events, the number of vehicles per recall event, the assumed number of vehicles that will be brought in by customers for repair (take rate), and the cost per vehicle for each recall event. The estimated cost of a recall campaign that is accrued on an individual basis is most sensitive to our estimated assumed take rate that is primarily developed based on our historical take rate experience. A 10% increase in the estimated take rate for all recall campaigns would increase the estimated cost by approximately $0.3 billion.\n",
      "Actual experience could differ from the amounts estimated requiring adjustments to these liabilities in future periods. Due to the uncertainty and potential volatility of the factors contributing to developing estimates, changes in our assumptions could materially affect our results of operations.\n",
      "Sales Incentives The estimated effect of sales incentives offered to dealers and end customers is recorded as a reduction of Automotive net sales and revenue at the time of sale. There may be numerous types of incentives available at any particular time. Incentive programs are generally specific to brand, model or sales region and are for specified time periods, which may be extended. Significant factors used in estimating the cost of incentives include forecasted sales volume, product mix, and the rate of customer acceptance of incentive programs, all of which are estimated based on historical experience and assumptions concerning future customer behavior and market conditions. A change in any of these factors affecting the estimate could have a significant effect on recorded sales incentives. Subsequent adjustments to incentive estimates are possible as facts and circumstances change over time, which could affect the revenue previously recognized in Automotive net sales and revenue.\n",
      "Valuation of GM Financial Equipment on Operating Leases Assets and Residuals GM Financial has investments in leased vehicles recorded as operating leases, which relate to vehicle leases to retail customers with lease terms that typically range from two to five years. At the beginning of the lease an estimate is made of the expected residual value at the end of the lease term. The expected residual value is based on third-party data that considers various data points and assumptions, including, but not limited to, recent auction values, the expected future volume of returning leased vehicles, used vehicle prices, manufacturer incentive programs and fuel prices. Realization of the residual values is dependent on the future ability to market the vehicles under prevailing market conditions. The customer is obligated to make payments during the term of the lease for the difference between the purchase price and the contract residual value plus a money factor. Since the customer is not obligated to purchase the vehicle at the end of the contract, we are exposed to a risk of loss to the extent the customer returns the vehicle prior to or at the end of the lease term and the value of the vehicle is below the expected residual value estimated at the inception of the lease.\n",
      "The following table summarizes vehicles included in GM Financial equipment on operating leases, net (vehicles in thousands):\n",
      "At December 31, 2019, the estimated residual value of our leased assets at the end of the lease term was $30.4 billion. We periodically review the adequacy of the depreciation rates. If we believe that the expected residual values of the leased assets have changed, we revise the depreciation rate to ensure the net investment in the operating leases reflects the revised estimate of expected residual value at the end of the lease term. Such adjustments to the depreciation rate would result in a change in depreciation expense on leased assets which is recorded prospectively on a straight-line basis. The following table illustrates the effect of a 1% change in the estimated residual values at December 31, 2019, which would increase or decrease depreciation expense over the remaining term of our operating lease portfolio, holding all other assumptions constant (dollars in millions):\n",
      "We also evaluate the carrying value of the operating leases aggregated by vehicle make, year and model into leased asset groups, check for indicators of impairment and test for impairment to the extent necessary in accordance with applicable accounting standards. We believe no impairment indicators existed during 2019, 2018 or 2017.\n",
      "Pension and OPEB Plans Our defined benefit pension plans are accounted for on an actuarial basis, which requires the selection of various assumptions, including an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, a discount rate, mortality rates of participants and expectation of mortality improvement. Our pension obligations include Korean statutory pension payments that are valued on a walk away basis. The expected long-term rate of return on U.S. plan assets that is utilized in determining pension expense is derived from periodic studies, which include a review of asset allocation strategies, anticipated future long-term performance of individual asset classes, risks using standard deviations and correlations of returns among the asset classes that comprise the plans' asset mix. While the studies give appropriate consideration to recent plan performance and historical returns, the assumptions are primarily long-term, prospective rates of return.\n",
      "In December 2019 an investment policy study was completed for the U.S. pension plans. As a result of changes to our capital market assumptions the weighted-average long-term rate of return on assets decreased from 6.4% at December 31, 2018 to 5.9% at December 31, 2019. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets used in determining pension expense for non-U.S. plans is determined in a similar manner to the U.S. plans.\n",
      "Another key assumption in determining net pension and OPEB expense is the assumed discount rate used to discount plan obligations. We estimate the assumed discount rate for U.S. plans using a cash flow matching approach, which uses projected cash flows matched to spot rates along a high quality corporate bond yield curve to determine the weighted-average discount rate for the calculation of the present value of cash flows. We apply the individual annual yield curve rates instead of the assumed discount rate to determine the service cost and interest cost, which more specifically links the cash flows related to service cost and interest cost to bonds maturing in their year of payment.\n",
      "The Society of Actuaries (SOA) issued mortality improvement tables in the three months ended December 31, 2019. We reviewed our recent mortality experience and we determined our current mortality assumptions are appropriate to measure our December 31, 2019 U.S. pension and OPEB plans obligations.\n",
      "Significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect the pension obligations. The effects of actual results differing from assumptions and the changing of assumptions are included in unamortized net actuarial gains and losses that are subject to amortization to pension expense over future periods. The unamortized pre-tax actuarial loss on our pension plans was $6.7 billion and $4.7 billion at December 31, 2019 and 2018. The year-over-year change is primarily due to a decrease in discount rates partially offset by higher than expected asset returns. At December 31, 2019, $3.0 billion of the unamortized pre-tax actuarial loss is outside the corridor (primarily 10% of the projected benefit obligation (PBO) and subject to amortization. The weighted-average amortization period for the pension obligation is approximately 16 years resulting in amortization expense of $0.2 billion in 2020.\n",
      "The underfunded status of the U.S. pension plans increased by $0.4 billion in the year ended December 31, 2019 to $5.4 billion primarily due to: (1) the unfavorable effect of a decrease in discount rates of $6.4 billion; and (2) service and interest costs of $2.4 billion; partially offset by (3) a favorable effect of actual returns on plan assets of $8.5 billion.\n",
      "The following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for the pension plans, holding all other assumptions constant:\n",
      "Refer to Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on pension contributions, investment strategies, assumptions, the change in benefit obligations and related plan assets, pension funding requirements and future net benefit payments. Refer to Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the inputs used to determine fair value for each significant asset class or category.\n",
      "Valuation of Deferred Tax Assets The ability to realize deferred tax assets depends on the ability to generate sufficient taxable income within the carryback or carryforward periods provided for in the tax law for each applicable tax jurisdiction. The assessment regarding whether a valuation allowance is required or should be adjusted is based on an evaluation of possible sources of taxable income and also considers all available positive and negative evidence factors. Our accounting for the valuation of deferred tax assets represents our best estimate of future events. Changes in our current estimates, due to unanticipated market conditions, governmental legislative actions or events, could have a material effect on our ability to utilize deferred tax assets. Refer to Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on the composition of these valuation allowances.\n",
      "Forward-Looking Statements This report and the other reports filed by us with the SEC from time to time, as well as statements incorporated by reference herein and related comments by our management, may include \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the U.S. federal securities laws.

      "these non-gaap measures allow management and investors to view operating trends, perform analytical comparisons and benchmark performance between periods and among geographic regions to understand operating performance without regard to items we do not consider a component of our core operating performance. furthermore, these non-gaap measures allow investors the opportunity to measure and monitor our performance against our externally communicated targets and evaluate the investment decisions being made by management to improve roic-adjusted. management uses these measures in its financial, investment and operational decision-making processes, for internal reporting and as part of its forecasting and budgeting processes. further, our board of directors uses certain of these and other measures as key metrics to determine management performance under our performance-based compensation plans. for these reasons we believe these non-gaap measures are useful for our investors.\n",
      "ebit-adjusted ebit-adjusted is presented net of noncontrolling interests and is used by management and can be used by investors to review our consolidated operating results because it excludes automotive interest income, automotive interest expense and income taxes as well as certain additional adjustments that are not considered part of our core operations. examples of adjustments to ebit include but are not limited to impairment charges on long-lived assets and other exit costs resulting from strategic shifts in our operations or discrete market and business conditions; costs arising from the ignition switch recall and related legal matters; and certain currency devaluations associated with hyperinflationary economies. for ebit-adjusted and our other non-gaap measures, once we have made an adjustment in the current period for an item, we will also adjust the related non-gaap measure in any future periods in which there is an impact from the item. our corresponding measure for our gm financial segment is ebt-adjusted.\n",
      "eps-diluted-adjusted eps-diluted-adjusted is used by management and can be used by investors to review our consolidated diluted eps results on a consistent basis. eps-diluted-adjusted is calculated as net income attributable to common stockholders-diluted less income (loss) from discontinued operations on an after-tax basis, adjustments noted above for ebit-adjusted and certain income tax adjustments divided by weighted-average common shares outstanding-diluted. examples of income tax adjustments include the establishment or reversal of significant deferred tax asset valuation allowances.\n",
      "etr-adjusted etr-adjusted is used by management and can be used by investors to review the consolidated effective tax rate for our core operations on a consistent basis. etr-adjusted is calculated as income tax expense less the income tax related to the adjustments noted above for ebit-adjusted and the income tax adjustments noted above for eps-diluted-adjusted divided by income before income taxes less adjustments. when we provide an expected adjusted effective tax rate, we do not provide an expected effective tax rate because the u.s. gaap measure may include significant adjustments that are difficult to predict.\n",

      "the estimated amount accrued for recall campaigns at the time of vehicle sale is most sensitive to the estimated number of recall events, the number of vehicles per recall event, the assumed number of vehicles that will be brought in by customers for repair (take rate), and the cost per vehicle for each recall event. the estimated cost of a recall campaign that is accrued on an individual basis is most sensitive to our estimated assumed take rate that is primarily developed based on our historical take rate experience. a 10% increase in the estimated take rate for all recall campaigns would increase the estimated cost by approximately $0.3 billion.\n",
      "actual experience could differ from the amounts estimated requiring adjustments to these liabilities in future periods. due to the uncertainty and potential volatility of the factors contributing to developing estimates, changes in our assumptions could materially affect our results of operations.\n",
      "sales incentives the estimated effect of sales incentives offered to dealers and end customers is recorded as a reduction of automotive net sales and revenue at the time of sale. there may be numerous types of incentives available at any particular time. incentive programs are generally specific to brand, model or sales region and are for specified time periods, which may be extended. significant factors used in estimating the cost of incentives include forecasted sales volume, product mix, and the rate of customer acceptance of incentive programs, all of which are estimated based on historical experience and assumptions concerning future customer behavior and market conditions. a change in any of these factors affecting the estimate could have a significant effect on recorded sales incentives. subsequent adjustments to incentive estimates are possible as facts and circumstances change over time, which could affect the revenue previously recognized in automotive net sales and revenue.\n",
      "valuation of gm financial equipment on operating leases assets and residuals gm financial has investments in leased vehicles recorded as operating leases, which relate to vehicle leases to retail customers with lease terms that typically range from two to five years. at the beginning of the lease an estimate is made of the expected residual value at the end of the lease term. the expected residual value is based on third-party data that considers various data points and assumptions, including, but not limited to, recent auction values, the expected future volume of returning leased vehicles, used vehicle prices, manufacturer incentive programs and fuel prices. realization of the residual values is dependent on the future ability to market the vehicles under prevailing market conditions. the customer is obligated to make payments during the term of the lease for the difference between the purchase price and the contract residual value plus a money factor. since the customer is not obligated to purchase the vehicle at the end of the contract, we are exposed to a risk of loss to the extent the customer returns the vehicle prior to or at the end of the lease term and the value of the vehicle is below the expected residual value estimated at the inception of the lease.\n",
      "the following table summarizes vehicles included in gm financial equipment on operating leases, net (vehicles in thousands):\n",
      "at december 31, 2019, the estimated residual value of our leased assets at the end of the lease term was $30.4 billion. we periodically review the adequacy of the depreciation rates. if we believe that the expected residual values of the leased assets have changed, we revise the depreciation rate to ensure the net investment in the operating leases reflects the revised estimate of expected residual value at the end of the lease term. such adjustments to the depreciation rate would result in a change in depreciation expense on leased assets which is recorded prospectively on a straight-line basis. the following table illustrates the effect of a 1% change in the estimated residual values at december 31, 2019, which would increase or decrease depreciation expense over the remaining term of our operating lease portfolio, holding all other assumptions constant (dollars in millions):\n",
      "we also evaluate the carrying value of the operating leases aggregated by vehicle make, year and model into leased asset groups, check for indicators of impairment and test for impairment to the extent necessary in accordance with applicable accounting standards. we believe no impairment indicators existed during 2019, 2018 or 2017.\n",
      "pension and opeb plans our defined benefit pension plans are accounted for on an actuarial basis, which requires the selection of various assumptions, including an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, a discount rate, mortality rates of participants and expectation of mortality improvement. our pension obligations include korean statutory pension payments that are valued on a walk away basis. the expected long-term rate of return on u.s. plan assets that is utilized in determining pension expense is derived from periodic studies, which include a review of asset allocation strategies, anticipated future long-term performance of individual asset classes, risks using standard deviations and correlations of returns among the asset classes that comprise the plans' asset mix. while the studies give appropriate consideration to recent plan performance and historical returns, the assumptions are primarily long-term, prospective rates of return.\n",
      "in december 2019 an investment policy study was completed for the u.s. pension plans. as a result of changes to our capital market assumptions the weighted-average long-term rate of return on assets decreased from 6.4% at december 31, 2018 to 5.9% at december 31, 2019. the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets used in determining pension expense for non-u.s. plans is determined in a similar manner to the u.s. plans.\n",
      "another key assumption in determining net pension and opeb expense is the assumed discount rate used to discount plan obligations. we estimate the assumed discount rate for u.s. plans using a cash flow matching approach, which uses projected cash flows matched to spot rates along a high quality corporate bond yield curve to determine the weighted-average discount rate for the calculation of the present value of cash flows. we apply the individual annual yield curve rates instead of the assumed discount rate to determine the service cost and interest cost, which more specifically links the cash flows related to service cost and interest cost to bonds maturing in their year of payment.\n",
      "the society of actuaries (soa) issued mortality improvement tables in the three months ended december 31, 2019. we reviewed our recent mortality experience and we determined our current mortality assumptions are appropriate to measure our december 31, 2019 u.s. pension and opeb plans obligations.\n",
      "significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect the pension obligations. the effects of actual results differing from assumptions and the changing of assumptions are included in unamortized net actuarial gains and losses that are subject to amortization to pension expense over future periods. the unamortized pre-tax actuarial loss on our pension plans was $6.7 billion and $4.7 billion at december 31, 2019 and 2018. the year-over-year change is primarily due to a decrease in discount rates partially offset by higher than expected asset returns. at december 31, 2019, $3.0 billion of the unamortized pre-tax actuarial loss is outside the corridor (primarily 10% of the projected benefit obligation (pbo) and subject to amortization. the weighted-average amortization period for the pension obligation is approximately 16 years resulting in amortization expense of $0.2 billion in 2020.\n",
      "the underfunded status of the u.s. pension plans increased by $0.4 billion in the year ended december 31, 2019 to $5.4 billion primarily due to: (1) the unfavorable effect of a decrease in discount rates of $6.4 billion; and (2) service and interest costs of $2.4 billion; partially offset by (3) a favorable effect of actual returns on plan assets of $8.5 billion.\n",
      "the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for the pension plans, holding all other assumptions constant:\n",

      "another key assumption in determining net pension and opeb expense is the assumed discount rate used to discount plan obligations. we estimate the assumed discount rate for u.s. plans using a cash flow matching approach, which uses projected cash flows matched to spot rates along a high quality corporate bond yield curve to determine the weighted-average discount rate for the calculation of the present value of cash flows. we apply the individual annual yield curve rates instead of the assumed discount rate to determine the service cost and interest cost, which more specifically links the cash flows related to service cost and interest cost to bonds maturing in their year of payment.\n",

      "the estimates related to recall campaigns accrued at the time of vehicle sale are established by applying a paid loss approach that considers the number of historical recall campaigns and the estimated cost for each recall campaign these estimates consider the nature frequency and magnitude of historical recall campaigns and use key assumptions including the number of historical periods and the weighting of historical data in the reserve studies costs associated with recall campaigns not accrued at the time of vehicle sale are estimated based on the estimated cost of repairs and the estimated vehicles to be repaired depending on part availability and time to complete repairs we may from time to time offer courtesy transportation at no cost to our customers these estimates are reevaluated on an ongoing basis and based on the best available information revisions are made when necessary based on changes in these factors\n",

      "in december  an investment policy study was completed for the us pension plans as a result of changes to our capital market assumptions the weightedaverage longterm rate of return on assets decreased from  at december   to  at december   the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets used in determining pension expense for nonus plans is determined in a similar manner to the us plans\n",
      "another key assumption in determining net pension and opeb expense is the assumed discount rate used to discount plan obligations we estimate the assumed discount rate for us plans using a cash flow matching approach which uses projected cash flows matched to spot rates along a high quality corporate bond yield curve to determine the weightedaverage discount rate for the calculation of the present value of cash flows we apply the individual annual yield curve rates instead of the assumed discount rate to determine the service cost and interest cost which more specifically links the cash flows related to service cost and interest cost to bonds maturing in their year of payment\n",

   "source": [
    "Text complexity refers to \"a relative difficulty of reading, writing, or understanding a document, or a combination of these activities\" (Anand et al., 2020, *FTA*). Accounting and finance researchers have, in particular, studied the complexity of corporate disclosures, such as the Management Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) section of firms' annual report. More complex disclosures are more difficult to read and comprehend and thus increase processing costs for users of such disclosures (Anand et al., 2020, *FTA*). Researchers provide at least two reasons of why some corporate textual disclosures are more complex than others (Anand et al., 2020, *FTA*). On the one hand, complex reporting may be an attempt by managers to obfuscate information or conceal a firm’s poor performance. On the other hand, complex disclosures may be the result of complex business operations and regulatory reporting requirements, and not intentional obfuscation by firm’s management. Regardless of the reason, complex disclosures are associated with negative externalities, such as less transparent information environments and increased financial misstatement risk (Anand et al., 2020, *FTA*). Quantifying text complexity is not a straightforward task as methods used to quantify text complexity depend on the research question (such as whether a researcher is interested in measuring the difficulty of *reading* or *preparing* corporate disclosures) and underlying text source.\n",
    "\n",
    "To date, most accounting research in this area has focused on the relative difficulty of reading (i.e., the readability) of corporate disclosures, and used general text readability measures such as the fog index or Flesch-Kincaid readability score. For a given text, these measures output readability scores based on the average number of words per sentence and the average number of syllables per word, where higher scores indicate greater difficulty of reading the text (and thus higher text complexity). For example, the fog index (or Gunning fog index), which is widely used by accounting and finance researchers, is calculated as the weighted sum of the average number of words per sentence and the average number of complex words (i.e., words with three or more syllables) per word:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$fog\\ index = 0.4\\ x\\ [(all\\ words\\ /\\ all\\ sentences)\\ +\\ (100\\ x\\ (complex\\ words\\ /\\ all\\ words))]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "As with most traditional readability measures created to differentiate grade school textbooks, the fog index estimates the number of years of education needed to understand the text on a first reading. Thus, a fog index value of 16 implies that the reader needs 16 years of education to comprehend the text on a first reading. Loughran and McDonald (2014, *JF*) empirically demonstrate that the fog index is a poorly specified readability measure when applied to business documents, mostly because syllable counts are problematic for such documents. As a simple proxy for readability of annual reports, Loughran and McDonald (2014, *JF*) suggest using the natural log of gross 10-K file size (complete submission text file) available on the SEC’s EDGAR website, while controlling for firm size. This measure is easy to obtain, does not require problematic parsing of 10-Ks, and allows for straightforward replication. As with all textual analysis methods and techniques, the use of readability measures must consider the context of application. For example, although file-size proxies make sense for documents such as 10-K filings, it is less clear that this is a distinguishing feature of the text from an earnings conference call. Also, importantly, if the intention is to measure document readability, then researchers face the problem of separating the business and the document.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are numerous Python libraries that facilitate calculation of various text readability metrics, such as 'textstat' which we will use for this course (see https://pypi.org/project/textstat/)."

    "A common problem in textual analysis is to assess a degree of similarity between two (or more) pieces of text. Several studies in the accounting and finance literatures examine similarity of disclosures. For example, Cohen et al. (2020, *JF*) have used textual similarity analysis to examine whether changes to the language and construction of financial reports have implications for firms’ future returns and operations (and found that they have strong implications!). Text similarity can be defined on lexical and semantic levels (Anand et al., 2020, *FTA*). As explained by Anand et al. (2020, *FTA*, p. 294-295), \"Lexical similarity refers to similarity stemming from usage of common words or characters (e.g., “good” and “goodness” share similar characters). Semantic similarity refers to similarity based on word/phrase meaning similarity (e.g., “good” and “nice” have similar meanings). Measuring semantic similarity is a significantly more difficult problem and most measures of text similarity in the accounting and finance fields are lexical.\" The length of text is an important factor when considering which similarity metric to use (Anand et al., 2020, *FTA*). As explained by Anand et al. (2020, *FTA*, p. 295), \"If an input text is relatively long (five words or more), it is more appropriate to choose a similarity measure that operates on a word level. Conversely, if the text is rather short, it is more appropriate to work with measures that operate on a character level.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "There are various similarity measures for relatively long pieces of text (Anand et al., 2020, *FTA*). Most accounting and finance researchers use the cosine similarity measure to compare texts. Cosine similarity between two vectors u and v (see above) is defined as the cosine of angle between these two vectors. Without going into the technical details, cosine similarity is a measure of distance between two vectors. Values close to 1 indicate a high degree of similarity between two vectors, and values close to 0 indicate little similarity. Since we can represent text as vectors using the bag-of-words approach, we can calculate distance (similarity) between pieces of text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, I first show you a relatively simple textual similarity analysis, which I have taken from a textbook by Ana Bell (2018, *Get programming: Learn to code with Python*). In this analysis, the similarity between texts is calculated as the overlap (commonality) in terms of the words of the texts. Next, I will show you a more advanced textual similarity analysis, which I have taken from a paper by Anand et al. (2020, *FTA*). In this analysis, the similarity between texts is calculated as the cosine similarity between the texts. In this second analysis, several functions from the NLTK and Scikit-learn libraries are being used. You are not expected to know these individual functions for this course. It is enough to understand the overall process, and to be able to (slightly) adapt and use these Python codes to perform a (similar) textual similarity analysis."
