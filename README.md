This repository contains the notebooks and exercises that have been used in the 2021-2022 edition of the Data Analytics for Accounting and Control course at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. The purpose of this course is to explore and provide an understanding of data analytics for accounting and control, and to teach students to solve problems using structured programming. The course assumes that the student has prior knowledge of the Python programming language. In the 2021-2022 edition of the course, the programming part (which was about 50% of the course contents) consisted of 6 weekly notebooks, and associated weekly tutorial (and for 4 weeks also self-study) exercises. These were structured around the following 6 themes/topics:
- Additional Python
- Additional NumPy and pandas
- Basic statistical analysis using Python
- Regression analysis using Python
- Text analytics using Python
- Machine learning using Python


The Data folder contains the datasets that are used in the different notebooks. The 'uscecchini28.csv' and 'amazon.csv' files are excluded, due to their big size. These files are publicly available via https://github.com/JarFraud/FraudDetection and https://kaggle.com (file: '1429_1.csv'), however.
